The script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple Snake game with a graphical user interface.

The game window is initialized with a canvas for drawing, a label to display the score, and placeholders for functions handling direction change, collision checking, and game over scenarios.

The Snake class manages the properties and behavior of the snake, including its initial position and the creation of snake squares on the canvas.

The Food class manages the properties and placement of the food, ensuring it appears randomly on the canvas.

The next_turn function handles the movement of the snake, updating its coordinates, creating new squares, and deleting the tail. It then schedules the next turn after a delay.

Placeholder functions (change_direction, check_collisions, game_over) are left for further development in handling user input, collision detection, and game over scenarios.

The Tkinter main loop (window.mainloop()) keeps the window running, continuously updating and responding to user input or scheduled events.
